/**
 * Opera Bot, by Patrick B
 * Compile: javac -cp C:\Users\Suzan\Documents\GitHub\ICS3U\Robocode\robocode\libs\robocode.jar Blais_Patrick.java
 *
 * Uses randomized movement (RNG based) to make it harder to hit, while being a Simple Robot.
 * Incorporates Predictive Targetting, hopefully without getting disabled by missing every shot.
 * Shoots differently depending on range, to prevent losing too much energy on a miss.
 *
 * My strategy: Get the highest amount of points through Survival. When in practice matches against other classmates, I had less damage but significantly more survival points.
 * I've messed around with other types of shooters, tweaking values, bullet powers, but
 * increasing the bullet power could harm my robots ability to survive, since the shooter is not perfect.
